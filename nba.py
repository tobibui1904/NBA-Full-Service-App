    st.write("For the Autoregressive, I build it from scratch. In statistics, econometrics and signal processing, an autoregressive (AR) model is a representation of a type of random process; as such, it is used to describe certain time-varying processes in nature, economics, behavior, etc. The autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term (an imperfectly predictable term); thus the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation (or recurrence relation which should not be confused with differential equation). Together with the moving-average (MA) model, it is a special case and key component of the more general autoregressiveâ€“moving-average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models of time series, which have a more complicated stochastic structure; it is also a special case of the vector autoregressive model (VAR), which consists of a system of more than one interlocking stochastic difference equation in more than one evolving random variable. Contrary to the moving-average (MA) model, the autoregressive model is not always stationary as it may contain a unit root. The main purpose of this algorithm is to predict the chosen stats in future seasons as long as you wanted it to be. But the recommendation is 10 for accuracy")
    st.write("For the RNN, I import it using scikit-learn library from Python. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural networks where connections between nodes can create a cycle, allowing output from some nodes to affect subsequent input to the same nodes. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Derived from feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process variable length sequences of inputs.This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented, connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition. Recurrent neural networks are theoretically Turing complete and can run arbitrary programs to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. The term recurrent neural network is used to refer to the class of networks with an infinite impulse response, whereas convolutional neural network refers to the class of finite impulse response. Both classes of networks exhibit temporal dynamic behavior.[8] A finite impulse recurrent network is a directed acyclic graph that can be unrolled and replaced with a strictly feedforward neural network, while an infinite impulse recurrent network is a directed cyclic graph that can not be unrolled. The main purpose of this algorithm is to predict the chosen stats while comparing to current active players to see how he's performing in the future so it might take a long time to run. Additionally, this can only predict the next season")

Its ease of use and flexibility have fueled its adoption, as it handles both classification and regression problems.")
